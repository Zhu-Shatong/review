We sincerely thank the reviewer for the insightful comments and valuable feedback. We are encouraged by your recognition of our paper's core ideas, and we understand your concerns regarding the novelty of our implementation approach and the performance in the ablation studies. We will address each of these points in detail.

**Response to the Questions**

1. **Regarding Typographical Errors in Q1 and Q2**

We apologize for these oversights and appreciate the reviewer’s attention to detail. The use of $o_i$ was indeed a typo and should have been consistently written as $\tau_i$. Each $Q_i$ is conditioned on the entire trajectory $\tau_i$ rather than on individual observations $o_i$, as we utilize RNNs to capture temporal dependencies within the agent's history.

Similarly, regarding Q2, the intended terms were "POWQMIX," "CW-QMIX," and "$Q_2$," which we inadvertently misrepresented.

We will correct these errors to ensure consistency and clarity in the revised submission.

2. **Regarding the Selection of $\alpha$ and Weights**

In Section 4, we first set the weight for the potentially optimal joint action as 1 and for other joint actions as $\alpha \in [0,1)$, aligning with the weighting function (Equation (10) in WQMIX paper) as commonly applied in the WQMIX methodology.

We clarify that Theorem 2 holds strictly when $\alpha = 0$. As indicated in our statement following the definition, both the theory and implementation in our work specify $\alpha = 0$ for consistency.

According to the proof of Theorem 2 in the appendix, using weights of (5,0) does not affect the theorem's validity but only influences gradient stability and perturbation. We conducted ablation studies (Figure 4) and found that setting the weight to 5 for optimal actions yielded the best performance, so we chose (5,0) as our default parameter. Meanwhile, (1, $\alpha$) remains WQMIX’s default. We respect their choice and performed thorough ablations to address any potential concerns arising from this difference.

3. **Regarding the Ablation**

First, we would like to clarify why our algorithm's performance might appear suboptimal: the fixed constant $C$ value (0.05) does not fully reveal the algorithm’s potential. Through additional ablation studies, we found that setting $C$ to 1 for Predator-Prey and 0.01 for SMAC produces the best results. Due to space limitations, we cannot display these additional ablation tables in this rebuttal, but we invite you to review them in our response to another reviewer. These results demonstrate that, with appropriately tuned $C$ values, our algorithm outperforms both WQMIX and QMIX, even with larger networks or adjusted weights. We would gladly include these results in a revised version for clarity.

In response to your concerns regarding performance in the original ablation studies, we provide the following summary of the environments:

In line with PyMARL2 paper’s definitions, two environments exhibit varying degrees of monotonicity. Based on these characteristics, WQMIX is more suited for Predator-Prey, and QMIX performs better on SMAC. While both benefit from fine-tuning in their respective environments, they cannot achieve balanced performance across both tasks. We invite you to observe WQMIX's poor performance on the more complex SMAC "corridor" and QMIX’s difficulty with the non-monotonic Predator-Prey problem—limitations that parameter tuning alone cannot resolve. 

To ensure fair comparison, we adhered to the original hyperparameters specified in each paper **without selective tuning to diminish performance**.

In contrast, our POWQMIX achieves consistently strong results across both environments, transcending the isolated strengths of WQMIX and QMIX.

Finally, our paper's central idea and theoretical contribution go beyond a simple weighted approach; our work introduces a structured methodology and theoretical foundations that significantly advance weighting methods. While weighting is foundational, our complete derivation, theoretical insights, and robust empirical performance substantiate the value of our approach.
